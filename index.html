                <h2>Ancient Rome</h2>
                <p>The Romans believed that Mount Vesuvius was dedicated to Hercules, while performing his labors, he passed near the city of Cuma on the way to Sicily and found a place there,
                    which was called the Phlegrean Valley (Valley of Fire), from the hill that long ago emitted fire, which is now called Vesuvius.
                    With the help of the gods, he pacified the region and moved on.
                    as well as the city of Herculaneum was named after her.
